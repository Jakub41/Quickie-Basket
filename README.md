# Quickie-Basket
A Basketball Game made with [CreateJS](http://createjs.com/).

## Concept
This project is in most general terms about the development of a game using the CreateJS Library. This game should be easy, inviting and addictive. Something people can always bring with them even on their mobile devices.

The game is a very easy and intuitive basketball game, which in reality is about shooting the basketball to the hoop. It is designed and intended for people who are looking for a funny and simple mobile app to always have with them on their mobile devices. Quickie Basket is meant to be played on a smartphone or a tablet on any occasion such as on the train on the way to work or on the bus going to school, when you have a little time to kill or just want to relax and have fun. This is the game one will be looking for.
Simple, quick and funny.
